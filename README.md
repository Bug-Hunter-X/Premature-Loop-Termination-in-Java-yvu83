This repository showcases a common coding error in Java involving premature loop termination. The `bug.java` file contains code that uses a `break` statement to prematurely exit a `while` loop. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incomplete execution. The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected version, demonstrating how to handle loop conditions correctly to avoid premature termination.
